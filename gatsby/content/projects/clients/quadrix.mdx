The current focus is on creating a simple and stable chat application
which runs on all platforms. Quadrix is available on Linux
(amd64, arm64, armhf), Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.
It has even been tested on a PinePhone runnning Mobian/Phosh.
There is no VoIP support yet, but Quadrix does offer in-app
videoconferencing (via the Jitsi Meet SDK). Please visit the
Github repo for more information. Feel free to open an issue on Github,
or leave a comment at #quadrix:matrix.org
